# Employee Register System

## Project Overview
The Employee Register System is a console-based Java application that allows organizations to store and manage employee details. The application collects key information about each employee, such as their first name, last name, mobile number, email, and address, and organizes them in a sorted manner. The employee records are sorted by first name in descending order.

## Features
- Collects employee details including:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Mobile Number
- Email Address
- Physical Address
- Dynamically stores employee records in a list without a fixed size limit.
- Sorts employees by their first name in descending alphabetical order.
- Displays the employee details in a neatly formatted table using System.out.format().

## Technologies Used
- Java: Core language used for implementing the application.
- Java Collections Framework: Specifically, the ArrayList is used to store employee objects dynamically.
- Comparable Interface: Used to define custom sorting logic based on the employee's first name.
- Scanner Class: Used to capture user input for employee details.
- Java Format Specifiers: Used to format the output into a clean table.
